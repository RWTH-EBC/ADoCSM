This characteristic is such that the relative change of the flow coefficient is proportional to the change in the opening position:
<p> d(rc)/d(pos) = k d(pos).</p>
<p> The constant k is expressed in terms of the rangeability, i.e., the ratio between the maximum and the minimum useful flow coefficient:</p>
<p> rangeability = exp(k) = rc(1.0)/rc(0.0).</p>
<p> The theoretical characteristic has a non-zero opening when pos = 0; the implemented characteristic is modified so that the valve closes linearly when pos &lt; delta.</p>
